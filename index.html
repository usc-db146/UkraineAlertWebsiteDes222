      <div class = "About-Text" id="About-Air-Alerts-Text">It was the German’s zeppelin attacks in the first world war that confirmed aerial bombardment as a deadly strategy of 20th century combat. During 1914-1918 1,239 civilians were killed by bombs dropped by zeppelins, the attacks produced far greater psychological damage impact than injury, death and destruction rained on London. Before warning systems coastal look-out stations spotted enemy aircraft approaching across the channel and pass on warning to military, police, factories, and institutions where special precautionary measures are required in the public interest. In June 1917, the deadly assault of 14 aircraft dropping 118 bombs and killing 162 people and injuring 426 more. After this deadly strike: purpose-built air-raid shelters and air-raid warning systems were created. This warning system was initially relayed by telephone to vital war infrastructure. Then the proposed system of six-horsepower sirens suspended below hydrogen balloons that would float 1,500 feet above ground and sound the horns. This system was rolled out because the armed forces couldn’t protect people but could at least warn them. The concern for how far the sound of sirens would carry. From 1937 to 1938 the scale of sirens ranged from ‘arresting’ to ‘just perceptible’ as well as a noise measure. The first air-raid sirens sounded in London on September 1939 but was a false alarm due to allied aircraft. After that Luftwaffe’s Blitz bombing raids intensified and from September 1940 to May 1941 London was bombed nightly. As the Cold War heated up in the 1950s the air-raid sirens we re-deployed. The 180-horse power siren developed in 1952 still holds record for loudest siren capable of being heard 25 miles away. This was decommissioned in 1993 at the end of the cold war but is now unecessary once again within Ukraine.</div><br>

      <div class = "About-Text" id="About-Ukraine-War-Text">Ukraine’s ties with the EU brought tensions to Russia in 2013-2014. President Yanukovych, acting under pressure from his supporters in Moscow, scrapped plans for a closer economic relationship with the EU. Many Ukrainians perceived Yanukovych’s decision as a betrayal by a deeply corrupt and incompetent government, and it ignited countrywide protests known as Euromaidan Putin framed the ensuring tumult of Euromaidan, which forced Yanukovych from power, as a Western-backed “fascist coup” that endangered the ethic Russian majority in Crimea. In response Putin ordered a covert invasion of Crimea and justified that “There is a limit to everything. And with Ukraine, our western partners have crossed the line” when he addressed formalizing the annexation. But then leading up to Ukraine’s involvement with NATO’s 2008 summit, Putin warned U.S. diplomats that steps to bring Ukraine into the alliance “Would be a hostile act towards Russia”. Despite Ukraine remaining a nonmember they grew ties with NATO in years leading up to the 2022 invasion. In 2020 Ukraine became one of six enhanced opportunity partners, a special status for the bloc’s closest nonmember allies. Moreover, Kyiv affirmed its goal to eventually gain full NATO membership. Russia made several security demands of the United States and NATO including that they cease expanding the alliance, seek Russian consent for certain NATO deployments, remove U.S> nuclear weapons from Europe. Alliance leaders responded that they were open to new diplomacy but were unwilling to discuss shutting NATO’s doors to new members. Then in February 2022, Russia embarked on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine with the aim of toppling the Western-aligned government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. </div><br>

      <div class = "About-Text" id="About-Current-Update-Text">Former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen put forward a proposal for Ukraine to join the military alliance but stripped of the territories occupied by Russia. German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s governing coalition has agreed to double German military aid for Ukraine next year to 8 billion euros ($8.54 billion), Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter. A senior Ukrainian military official played a key role in the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea last year, according to a joint investigation by the Washington Post and Der Spiegel published Saturday. Latvia’s president said Russia is planning for a long war in Ukraine and urged wavering allies to continue supplying military support to Kyiv or risk Moscow threatening other countries. Russia on Saturday launched a missile attack on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and the surrounding region for the first time in more than seven weeks, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian border guards said they had retaken a village in the country’s northeast adjacent to the Russian border. In the east, military spokesperson Oleskandr Shtupun said Ukrainian troops had repelled 35 Russian assaults in and near Avdiivka, which has been under intense fire since mid-October. Russian authorities said Saturday they had launched a “terrorism” probe after the derailment of a goods train southwest of Moscow. Russian authorities have yet to blame Ukraine for Saturday’s incident.</div><br>
